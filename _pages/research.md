# Research Overview

My research develops real-time, probabilistic, and optimization-based algorithms for autonomous systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments.  
The work spans three core areas that integrate robotics, sensing, and applied stochastic modeling.

## 1. Multi-Robot Coordination & Real-Time Decision-Making

I design algorithms that enable heterogeneous teams of robots—drones, surface vessels, underwater vehicles, and fixed sensors—to collaborate efficiently in dynamic, data-limited settings.  
This work includes:

- Cooperative mission planning  
- Distributed control and communication  
- Task allocation for mixed robot teams  
- Real-time adaptation under uncertainty  

These methods support large-area ocean monitoring, maritime surveillance, and rapid decision-making for disaster and environmental response.

## 2. Probabilistic Modeling for Sensing & Outlier Detection

I develop stochastic modeling frameworks to characterize uncertain target arrivals and environmental processes using **Poisson processes** and **log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCP)**.  
These models enable autonomous systems to:

- Detect atypical or anomalous activity  
- Quantify uncertainty in arrival patterns  
- Fuse heterogeneous environmental and sensor data  
- Improve robustness against rare, transient, or unexpected events  

Examples include identifying abnormal vessel traffic, unusual marine animal movement, and environmental anomalies in coastal regions.

## 3. Optimal Sensor Networks & Adaptive Placement

I design optimization methods for deploying fixed and mobile sensor networks that maximize detection performance in uncertain environments.  
My work incorporates:

- Void-probability and variance-aware approximations  
- Real-time, near-optimal repositioning algorithms  
- Distributed sensing strategies for multi-robot teams  
- Adaptive coverage of spatially variable or dynamic regions  

These approaches enhance the capability of autonomous sensing systems to detect rare events and support persistent monitoring in complex marine environments.
