## Welcome

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Southern University.  
My research focuses on **multi-robot systems**, **sensor networks**, **probabilistic modeling**, and **real-time optimization under uncertainty**. I develop algorithms that enable autonomous systems to sense, learn, and make decisions efficiently in dynamic and uncertain environments.

My work spans applications in:
- Autonomous drones and surface vessels  
- Maritime domain awareness and naval sensing  
- Environmental monitoring & water-quality intelligence  
- Disaster response and infrastructure resilience  
- Distributed optimization for multi-agent systems  

I am always interested in collaborative research and interdisciplinary partnerships across robotics, control systems, environmental sensing, and defense applications.
