# Research Overview

My research focuses on developing real-time, probabilistic, and optimization-based algorithms for autonomous systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments.  
The three primary areas of my work are:

---

## 1. Multi-Robot Coordination & Real-Time Decision-Making

I develop algorithms that enable heterogeneous teams of robots—drones, surface vessels, and sensors—to operate efficiently in dynamic environments.  
Key themes include cooperative planning, distributed control, task allocation, and real-time mission adaptation. This work supports applications in ocean monitoring, disaster response, and environmental intelligence.

## 2. Probabilistic Modeling for Sensing & Outlier Detection

I create stochastic models to characterize uncertain target arrivals using Poisson processes and log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCP).  
These methods allow autonomous systems to identify atypical or anomalous behaviors in real time, enabling early detection of unusual activity such as abnormal vessel traffic, marine mammal movement, or environmental disturbances.

## 3. Optimal Sensor Networks & Adaptive Placement

I design near-optimal sensor placement strategies that maximize detection performance under uncertainty.  
Using void-probability approximations, variance-aware optimization, and real-time adaptive repositioning, this work improves the ability of distributed sensor networks—fixed or mobile—to detect rare, transient, or spatially-variable targets in complex marine environments.
